# MQTT Log Inspector: Streamlined Error Analysis

## Project Overview
The **MQTT Log Inspector** is a Python-based tool designed to efficiently parse and analyze log files related to MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) systems. This project helps engineers quickly extract relevant error messages, debug issues, and gain insights from large log files.

## Features
- Parses MQTT log files for key error messages and relevant data.
- Organizes log data into a structured and human-readable format.
- Displays real-time errors or saves output to a file for further analysis.
- Customizable for different MQTT broker implementations or log formats.

## Motivation
As MQTT is widely used in IoT and real-time communication systems, managing and debugging MQTT logs can become overwhelming. This tool was created to simplify the process, saving time and ensuring accuracy in log analysis.

## Installation
